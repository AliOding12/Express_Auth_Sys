# Express Auth –  Authentication System

## What is Express Auth?
Express Auth is a robust, modular authentication system built with Node.js and Express. It provides all the essential and advanced features needed for secure user authentication and authorization in modern web applications. Each feature is implemented as a separate module for easy customization and scalability.

##  Why Use Express Auth?
- **Comprehensive Security:** Includes password hashing, session management, CSRF/XSS protection, rate limiting, and more.
- **Modular Design:** Each feature (registration, login, 2FA, OAuth, etc.) is in its own file for clarity and maintainability.
- **Production-Ready:** Implements best practices for authentication, authorization, and auditing.
- **Easy Integration:** Plug-and-play modules for rapid development.

##  How It Works
1. **User Registration:** New users register with a username, email, and password. Passwords are hashed before storage.
2. **Login & Session:** Users log in, sessions are created, and roles are assigned. Account lockout and 2FA are supported.
3. **Password Reset & Email Verification:** Users can reset passwords and verify emails via secure tokens.
4. **Role-Based Access:** Middleware restricts access to routes based on user roles.
5. **Security:** CSRF/XSS protection, rate limiting, and audit logging are built-in for maximum security.
6. **OAuth & Social Login:** Easily extendable for Google, Facebook, and other providers.
